DECISION VALIDITY REPORT
========================

Generated (UTC): 2025-12-29 14:35:39

SUMMARY STATEMENT
-----------------
Decision unstable: dominated by overnight gaps and window-length choice.
You should with 85.0% probability NOT base a buy/sell decision solely on this historical data.

INTERPRETATION
--------------
This assessment evaluates how sensitive a trading decision is to
reasonable assumption changes (time window choice, volatility regime,
overnight gaps, execution friction, and data conventions).

A high invalidity probability means that small, plausible changes in
assumptions lead to materially different outcomes.

DOMINANT UNCERTAINTY SOURCES

 - overnight_gaps
 - window_length
